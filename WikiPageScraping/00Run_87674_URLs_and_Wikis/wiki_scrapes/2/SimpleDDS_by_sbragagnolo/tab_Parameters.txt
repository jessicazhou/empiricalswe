          <p>#Parameters</p>
<p>Parameters have nothing to do with strict publisher / subcsriber domain. But they are indeed useful. A parameter is an extra support that the domain master can have.</p>
<p>A parameter then is a name for a value holded by the domain master.  This means that i may need to have a named value, shared with several participants of the domain.</p>
<p>By example, in this implementation, the registration of types, ends up as a parameter, meaning that any participant can have access to it, by name.</p>
<p>This feature is specific of SimpleDDS, for being ROS-compatible. It is not implemented in MetaDDS, meaning that no one of the domains defined in MetaDDS will work with this examples. For this reason, we will have examples just for External domain</p>
<pre><code>domain := DDSExternallyDefinedDomain onSimpleDDS: 'http://127.0.0.1:11311'.
participant := MDDSDomainParticipant domain: domain name: 'publisher-participant' ip: '127.0.0.1'.

parameter := domain createParameterNamed: 'parameter' for: participant.
parameter set: 2.
self assert: parameter get = 2.
</code></pre>
<p>The funny thing with this object parameter (From the class DDSBindedParameter) is that each time #set: is sent, the domain object will be noticed, and with that, each parameter holder of each participant that is using this parameter.</p>
